# Tree Leaf Recognition Using Image Processing

## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Python-based system that accurately recognizes and classifies tree species using leaf images. Additionally, the system detects whether a leaf is healthy or diseased, enhancing its potential applications in ecology, forestry, and biodiversity conservation.

### Key Objectives:
- **Tree Species Identification**: Classify leaves into corresponding species.
- **Disease Detection**: Differentiate between healthy and diseased leaves.
- **Accessibility**: Provide a tool for both experts and non-experts in tree identification.

### Use Cases:
- **Ecological Research**: Fast species identification for biodiversity studies.
- **Forest Management**: Monitor environmental health by detecting diseased leaves.
- **Educational Tool**: Assist students and researchers in learning tree species identification.
